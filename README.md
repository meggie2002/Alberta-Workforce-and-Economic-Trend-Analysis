# Alberta Workforce and Economic Trend Analysis
Alberta’s economy is driven by key industries such as oil & gas, agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and technology. This project analyzes labor and economic trends in Alberta by examining employment, GDP, gender and age participation, and average weekly earnings across industries. The goal is to understand how macroeconomic forces and events - like the COVID-19 pandemic - impact the province’s workforce and economic landscape.

## Objectives
1. Analyze gender-based employment patterns across Alberta’s industries.

3. Determine whether specific industries are dominated by particular age groups.
4. Assess the distribution of full-time versus part-time employment across industries.
5. Track changes in the proportion of male and female employment over time.
6. Rank the top five industries with the highest and lowest average weekly earnings.
7. Examine the overall distribution of average weekly earnings across different industries.
8. Calculate the average weekly earnings and average employment for each industry.
9. Identify the largest and smallest industries in terms of employment opportunities.
10. Quantify job losses by industry in Alberta during the COVID-19 period (March 2020 to December 2021).
11. Evaluate whether industries with higher pre-pandemic GDP experienced less impact during COVID-19.
12. Compare industries with the highest GDP growth to their employment levels and average earnings.
